## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, with research interests in computer vision, knowledge distillation, and their applications. Previously, I obtained my BSc and MSc in Computing from Imperial College London. 

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** image classification, 2D/3D oject detection
- **Knowledge Distillation:** cross-model, cross-architecture, and cross-modality transfer learning
